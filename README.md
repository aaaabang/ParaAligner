# ParaAligner

ParaAligner is an implementation of Smith-Waterman algorithm in a distributed way.

## Usage

### Requirement

You need to connect to Das-5.

### Setup

Users on Das-5 can not use `sudo` command, so you need to run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user` to install dependencies. You may also
need to run `chmod +x ./ssw_test` to make SSW executable. The same approach applies to other bash scripts.

### Command

Run `./stat.sh` to perform experiment.
